The study was performed with an iPhone 7. To use it, it is required to have an iOS device with a pressure sensitive screen.


## Pressure Study
The xcode project for the docking study described in the paper. 

To Test it as a demo: 
- First open it with as an xcode project and deploy it to an iPhone that has pressure sensing.
- Open the program and if being asked, enter 1 as the participant Id.
- You will first need to go through the process and callibrate your pressure level.
- For detailed interaction techniques, please refer to our paper.

## PseudoPressure Study
The xcode project for the pseudo-pressure study described in the paper.
